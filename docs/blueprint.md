# **App Name**: Elint Heist TOD

## Core Features:

- Scrolling UI: Horizontal Scrolling UI: Implement a seamless, looping horizontal scrolling interface for the Tactical Overlay Device (TOD).
- Holographic Styling: Holographic UI Elements: Style all UI elements (buttons, panels, text) with a translucent, glowing, wireframe effect to simulate a holographic appearance.
- AI Welcome Messages: AI-Generated Welcome Messages: Implement an AI-powered system to generate dynamic, spy-themed welcome messages from HQ for returning users. The tool will intelligently include calls to action and relevant updates about the game.
- Team Theme: Team-Based Theming: Dynamically change the TOD's color scheme based on the player's selected faction (red for Shadows, blue for Cyphers).
- Daily Team Codes: Daily Team Code: Provide daily team codes in the Command Center's Comms for the Spy Vs Spi: Elint Heist application. Daily team codes allow team members to share dropped items on the scanner page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary faction color: Dynamic switching between team-based colors with a cool color palette using a dominant electric blue for The Cyphers and a deep intense red for The Shadows.
- Secondary colors: Pale turquoise and Light salmon to complement and offset the faction primary.
- Accent color: Glowing White (#FFFFFF) for key holographic elements to create a glowing high-tech feel and use black only where higher contrast is required, like yellows.
- Orbitron for titles and main UI. Rajdhani for Message feed to simulate communication and display longer character chains of data.
- Custom designed, glowing icons representing spy tools, actions, and factions.
- Mobile-first responsive design to be easily enjoyed across different form factors, with a horizontally scrolling main interface, split into logical sections, accessible from every other.
- Use subtle, high-tech animations for transitions, data updates, and feedback to enhance immersion.
- Parallax scrolling, subtle 3D effect across the scrolling axis to enhance depth.
- Glowing red indicator for disabled tap state in command center
